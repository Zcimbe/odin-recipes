# odin-recipes
This is my first big TOP assignment, my task is to create a basic recipie 
website with the help of the html, git and other knowledge I have learnt 
along the way and possibly create a basis or foundation for future projects.

Possible skills demonstrated in this project could be html elements such as
bold and italic text, ordered lists, unordered lists, paragraphs, images, links
other pages, and appropiate commit messages.
